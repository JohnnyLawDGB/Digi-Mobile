# Digi-Mobile development profile for Android (experimental template)
# This truncated/pruned DigiByte node config is tuned for debugging on emulators
# or rooted devices. Pruning saves space without changing consensus rules.
# Approximate storage: prune=3500 uses ~3.5 GB on disk once synced.
# Logging here is noisier to aid debugging; trim debug entries for long runs.

# --- Storage and pruning ---
# Target block data size (in MiB). Smaller values shrink disk use but may
# increase time to rescan; larger values reduce network usage at the cost of
# space.
prune=3500

# Supply a datadir suited to your test environment.
# datadir=/data/data/com.example.app/files/.digibyte-dev

# --- Wallet ---
# Wallet stays enabled for dev scenarios that need signing/RPC. Disable if you
# only test P2P/network behavior.
