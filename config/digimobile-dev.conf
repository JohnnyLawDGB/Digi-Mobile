# DigiByte Core configuration for Digi-Mobile development/testing on Android
#
# Use this profile for emulator, rooted devices, or debugging sessions where
# verbose logs and RPC access are needed. Pruning remains enabled to keep
# storage footprint modest while retaining full consensus validation.

# --- Storage and pruning ---
# Target block data size (in MiB). 3500 balances space and fewer re-downloads.
# Smaller values shrink disk use but may increase time to rescan; larger values
# reduce network usage at the cost of space.
prune=3500

# Supply a datadir suited to your test environment.
# datadir=/data/data/com.example.app/files/.digibyte-dev

# --- Wallet ---
# Wallet stays enabled for dev scenarios that need signing/RPC. Disable if you
# only test P2P/network behavior.
# disablewallet=1

# --- Networking ---

# --- Resource tuning ---

# --- RPC ---
server=1
# Restrict RPC to localhost for safety. Exposing RPC on Android over Wi‑Fi or
# cellular is risky; use port forwarding or emulator loopback.

# --- Logging ---
# More verbose logging for troubleshooting. Remove or narrow debug topics once
# issues are resolved to save space and CPU.
