# DigiByte Core configuration for Digi-Mobile on Android (pruned node)
#
# This profile targets typical Android devices with ~10–20 GB free space.
# Pruning keeps consensus security intact while discarding historical blocks
# after validation. Increase the value if you have more storage.

# --- Storage and pruning ---
# Target size of the block data (in MiB). 3000 ≈ ~3 GB on disk. Smaller values
# save space but may require more network fetches during rescans; larger values
# reduce re-downloads at the cost of storage.
prune=3000

# Set datadir to an app-private directory when packaged with Digi-Mobile.
# Examples:
#  - /data/data/<your.package.name>/files/.digibyte
#  - /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/<your.package.name>/files/.digibyte
# Leave commented here so the app can inject a suitable path at runtime.
# datadir=/data/data/com.example.app/files/.digibyte

# --- Wallet ---
# Disable wallet to reduce memory footprint and background rescans.
disablewallet=1
# To enable wallet on Android, comment the line above and set:
# disablewallet=0
# Consider raising prune target and allow extra free space for wallet data.

# --- Networking ---
listen=1
listenonion=0
upnp=0
natpmp=0
onlynet=ipv4
maxconnections=12
maxuploadtarget=5000

# --- Resource tuning ---
dbcache=200
par=2
maxmempool=50

# --- RPC (disabled by default) ---
# RPC is off unless server=1 is set. Avoid exposing RPC on Android—only bind
# to localhost if you enable it.
# server=1
# rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
# rpcbind=127.0.0.1

# --- Logging ---
# Keep logging minimal to save storage and I/O.
shrinkdebugfile=1
logips=0
printtoconsole=0
# debug=0 is implicit; leave commented unless troubleshooting.
# debug=net
