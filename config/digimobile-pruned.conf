# Digi-Mobile pruned profile for Android (experimental template)
# This repository packages a truncated/pruned DigiByte node for Android. Adjust
# values to fit your device. Pruning keeps consensus intact while discarding
# older block data to save space.
# Approximate storage: prune=3000 uses ~3 GB on disk once synced.
# Logging below is tuned to be quieter for long-running use on small devices.

# --- Storage and pruning ---
# Target size of the block data (in MiB). Smaller values save space but may
# require re-downloading blocks during rescans; larger values reduce re-downloads
# at the cost of storage.
prune=3000

# Set datadir to an app-private directory when packaged with Digi-Mobile.
# Examples:
#  - /data/data/<your.package.name>/files/.digibyte
#  - /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/<your.package.name>/files/.digibyte
# Leave commented here so the app can inject a suitable path at runtime.
# datadir=/data/data/com.example.app/files/.digibyte

# --- Wallet ---
# Disable wallet to reduce memory footprint and background rescans.
disablewallet=1
# To enable wallet on Android, comment the line above and set:
# disablewallet=0
# Consider raising prune target and allow extra free space for wallet data.

# --- Networking ---
listen=1
listenonion=0
upnp=0
natpmp=0
onlynet=ipv4
maxconnections=12
maxuploadtarget=5000

# --- Resource tuning ---
dbcache=200
par=2
maxmempool=50

# --- RPC (disabled by default) ---
# RPC is off unless server=1 is set. Avoid exposing RPC on Android—only bind
# to localhost if you enable it.
# server=1
# rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
# rpcbind=127.0.0.1

# --- Logging ---
# Quieter defaults suitable for long-term running on a small device.
debuglogfile=debug.log
shrinkdebugfile=1
logips=0
printtoconsole=0
# debug=0 is implicit; leave commented unless troubleshooting.
# debug=net
