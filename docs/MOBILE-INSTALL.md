# Install Digi-Mobile on Android (APK download)

These steps are for non-technical users who want to try Digi-Mobile on an Android device **without building anything**.

> **Testing / hobby use only.**
> **Do not store large amounts of DigiByte in this app.**

## Install from Android using your browser

1. On your Android phone or tablet, open this GitHub repository in Chrome, Firefox, or another browser.
2. Tap the **Releases** section.
3. Download the latest Digi-Mobile APK.
4. If your device asks, allow installs from "unknown sources" so the APK can be installed.
5. Open the Digi-Mobile app after installation.
6. Tap **Set up and start node** inside the app to create the config/data folders and start the pruned DigiByte node.

## FAQ

- **Is this in the Play Store?**
  - Not yet. This build is experimental and meant for sideloading while the project stabilizes.
- **Why do I see warnings about unknown apps?**
  - Android shows this when you sideload (install from outside the Play Store). Use a device you are comfortable experimenting with.
- **What if it does not start?**
  - Close the app and re-open it, then tap **Set up and start node** again. The app will re-check the bundled files and try to start the node.
